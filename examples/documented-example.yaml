# Two basic modes are supported: audit and scanner.
#
# Audit mode is recommended: it sets audit rules to the kernel and keep a
# netlink connection open so that as soon as a rule is matched the process can
# be moved to a control group.  This mode supports detection of running
# applications by path, writing or reading specific files (or directories).
# This mode consumes few resources, since program is just listening.
#
# Scanner mode only works for 'execute' actions.  The running processes will be
# scanned every second, and matches, if any, will be distributed on groups.
# Scanning is more expensive than listening to a netlink socket.  This mode is
# recommended for those scenarios where audit rules are locked by administrator
# (once locked, they cannot be unlocked without rebooting the machine), or the
# Linux kernel is ancient and does not support multicast for Netlink
#
# Default is audit
mode: audit
audit:
  # There are three audit modes (meaningless in scanner mode) that dictates how
  # to setup the audit rules in the kernel: override, preserve and reuse
  #
  # * When override is used, program will delete any existing rules and leave
  #   only the ones configured
  #
  # * When preserve is used, program will add its rules over whatever rule
  #   already configured.  This is useful for coexisting with auditd.  However,
  #   if a lot of rule rewriting rules is done, old rules are not removed. and
  #   that can lead to surprises.
  #
  # * When reuse is used, no rules will be set up.  The use case if for those
  #   scenarios where you want to configure the rules in separate runs of this
  #   program (on run to configure rules, other to run as daemon)
  mode: override

logging:
  # File name where logs will be written
  file: /tmp/fetter.log
  # Standard error levels available.  Debug shows interesting info and it is not
  # too verbose.
  level: info

# This is the name of the cgroup path used by application (all cgroups created
# by this program will belong to it).  Default is 'fetter'; there is no reason
# to change it other than doing experiments or using several fetter applications
# in parallel.
name: fetter

# These are the rules.  By default there is none; the ones below are just
# examples.
rules:
  # Following rule will use a cgroup named browser for firefox.  Notice that you
  # need to know the name of the firefox executable (if in doubt, you can figure
  # it out by doing `ls -l /proc/PID/exe` to know the path, and 'ps -u | grep
  # firefox' to know the PID)
  - path: /usr/lib/firefox/firefox
    # Supported actions are execute (the most useful one: the process executing
    # a file will be moved to a control group), read, and write.
    action: execute
    # Name of the group should match one of the groups defined in their section.
    group: browsers

  # You can make several applications to share same cgroup, if you want.  That
  # way, the limits for that cgroup apply to both at once
  - path: /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromium-browser
    action: execute
    group: browsers

  - path: /usr/bin/emacs
    action: execute
    group: ides

  - path: /my/forbidden/file
    action: write
    # KILL is not a real cgroup, but a way to say fetter: kill whatever process
    # doing that action.  In this case, whenever a process writes to the file in
    # path, process will be killed
    group: KILL

  # This is an example where a process reading a file will be frozen in place by
  # the operating system (group honeypot has "freeze: true").  Process execution
  # will not continue, and it cannot be killed unless removed from cgroup, or
  # cgroup is manually thawed.  This will allow you to detect what processes
  # read/write to a file and examine them.
  - path: /my/forbidden/file
    action: read
    group: honeypot


# These control groups will be created by the application, with the limits
# specified for any of them.  By default there is none; the ones below are just
# examples.
#
# Note that while it is safe to cap CPU to any application, capping pids and or
# RAM might make those applications malfunction.  That would depend on how the
# applications manage error codes of operations that are denied by operating
# system.  Those operations would be the ones related to asking more RAM we
# allow them to use, or trying to spawn more children.  Think of a browser that
# uses a process-per-tab approach: if we cap processes to 20, the tab 21st would
# fail to display correctly
groups:
  - name: browsers
    # Max RAM, in Mbs, that all the processes in the group together can use.
    ram: 2000
    # Max number of processes that can be spawned simultaneously by processes in
    # the group.  A process spawned by a process of a group will remain in the
    # group.
    pids: 30
    # Max single-CPU %-age that processes in the group will be able to use.  For
    # instance, if you want to make sure your massively heavy parallel local
    # compilations do not make your UI unusable, you can create a group for
    # 'make' with a CPU limit.  Note that if you have N CPUs, you might want to
    # use values higher than 100.  For instance, in a machine with 8 CPUs
    # meaningful values are those between 0 (no juice) and 800 (no limit).  A
    # value of 400 would mean half of the CPU power would be available for other
    # tasks.
    cpu: 250
    # Default is false.  true means that the group is a freezer: processes
    # cannot continue execution or be killed by their owners (unless they are
    # root and familiar with the freeze subsystem).  Use of this feature is to
    # allow to detect and examine processes that do some action. Use with
    # caution.
    freeze: false
    # Default is false.  true means that instead of moving the process to a
    # cgroup the process will be killed.  It is a way of making sure (or
    # enforcing) some actions are never done.  Use with caution.
